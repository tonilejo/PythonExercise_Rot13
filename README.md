# Python Exercises
This is a list of exercises from Codewars I've completed in Python: 
-----------------------------------------------------------

1.) **ROT13** - is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet

2.) **Maximum subarray sum** - The maximum sum subarray problem consists in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers

3.) **First non-repeating character** - Write a function that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string

4.) **Highest and Lowest** - In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

5.) **Row of the odd triangle** - Given a triangle of consecutive odd numbers find the triangle's row knowing its index.

6.) **Product of consecutive Fib numbers** - Find numbers closest to the given product and if product is possible with fibb numbers

7.) **Strip Comments** - Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

8.) **Roman Numerals Encoder** - Create a function taking a positive integer as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.

9.) **Roman Numerals Helper** - Create a RomanNumerals class that can convert a roman numeral to and from an integer value. It should follow the API demonstrated in the examples below. Multiple roman numeral values will be tested for each helper method.
