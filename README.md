# Python Exercises
This is a list of exercises I've completed from Codewars, done in the Python: 
-----------------------------------------------------------

1.) ROT13 - is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet

2.) Maximum subarray sum - The maximum sum subarray problem consists in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers

3.) First non-repeating character - Write a function that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string
